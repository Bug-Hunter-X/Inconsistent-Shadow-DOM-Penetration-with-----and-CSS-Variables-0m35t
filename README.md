# Inconsistent Shadow DOM Penetration with >>> and CSS Variables

This repository demonstrates an uncommon issue encountered when using the `>>>` combinator in CSS to style elements within nested shadow DOM environments, especially when combined with CSS custom properties (variables).

The `>>>` combinator, while previously used to penetrate shadow boundaries, is deprecated and exhibits inconsistent behavior across different browsers. This inconsistency is heightened when used in conjunction with CSS variables.

**Problem:** The provided CSS code snippet attempts to style an inner element (`.inner-element`) by using a variable declared on a parent element outside the shadow DOM. While seemingly straightforward, the reliance on `>>>` and the variable interpolation can lead to unpredictable styles depending on the browser and shadow DOM implementation.

**Solution:** The proposed solution offers a more robust method that does not rely on deprecated features. This approach leverages `::part` or CSS variables that are specifically designed to be passed through the shadow boundary.  This improves consistency and maintainability across different browsers and shadow DOM versions.
